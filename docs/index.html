    <p>Past example for a mailing list</p>
    With the advent of Slack, the need for newsletters has diminished, but there’s a lot to talk about as we near the end of the season.
    TL:DR
    End of season is Monday, April 17
    Earthworm is on the road- questions to KDubb or Sozin
    Interdivision games are available to replace ANY matchups
    Prizes are on their way out- make sure I have your address
    We’re going to have to start thinking about talking about money
    Don’t count on Slack to store information- the archive limit deletes messages older than two weeks
    Contacting Admins for questions
    It’s spring break, so we’re on a family adventure for the next two weeks. If you need admin help, Kdubb and Sozin are your points of contact. You can also include the word ‘admin’ in your query in random, and it should notify all of us.
    Inter-division play is now fully open

    If there are any more inactive or hard to reach players in your division, you are now free to substitute an interdivision game for your matchup with that player. If you do, please notify them before seeking inter- opponents by tagging them with @username in your Slack channel. This serves two important purposes:
    lets them know that they’ll need to play an inter- game in place of their matchup with you
    gives them one final chance to schedule their match with you
    This second concept is a little complicated. Obviously, if you’ve had trouble getting a match with this player over the last two months, giving them another chance, and disrupting your planning isn’t really fair. We’d of course prefer that all of the division games get played, and if it turns out that you get the game in as a result, great, but we’re not going to force you to do so. It’s far more important that active players get their requisite number of games in.
    What we’d like to avoid (and really don’t foresee being a problem) is players playing an interdivision game instead of a matchup with an active player. If you feel that you’ve been sufficiently active, and a player in your division is taking an inter- game to avoid playing you, please contact us. Again, we don’t really expect this to be a problem.
    As a reminder, the required number of games for season 4 players is:
    Tier	Quota
    Deep Core (1a)	10
    Core Worlds (2a-2c)	9
    Inner Rim (3a-3f)	8
    Outer Rim (4a-4i)	8
    Unknown Reaches: (5a-5m)	8
    Note:
    Deep Core players cannot play interdivision matches.
    All other players must play their inter- match against a player at their same numbered level.
    Any games played above your quota will not be counted (ListJuggler will accept the result, but we’ll have to remove it manually)
    To arrange an interdivision match, go to the channel for your tier: #2_coreworlds, #3_innerrim, #4_outerrim, #5_unknownreaches.
    Instructions for escrow and reporting on interdivision matches can be found on our league reference manual
    Prizes
    I’m in the process of sending out the prizes for winners of Seasons 2 and 3. The prizes are for the top player in each division and for every player participating in Deep Core play. You get a range 1 ruler first, followed by a range 2 and a range 3 ruler for each instance of winning a prize. These are the beautiful black and yellow Vassal League custom rulers from Team Covenant, which has been an awesome prize sponsor during our first year.
    The first batch of Range 1 and 2 rulers for which I had confirmed addresses have been sent out. I’m not going to be able to send Range 3 rulers out until the middle of April- they require a special sized envelope that I’ll have to make, and I’ll be traveling. If you have a prize coming and have not gotten back to me with your address (or reconfirmed it despite sending it to me in September), please let me know. I’d prefer not to send things out without a really recent address (a couple of players have moved since then…)
    Money

    Our gracious sponsors at Team Covenant have supplied us with enough range rulers to get through Season 4’s prizes, with some left over for future incentives. However, they’re going to be ending their direct support with free prizes for us. We’d like to continue with custom prizes available to a large number of players at all levels- this is really important to us. Our other main sponsor, the Scum and Villainy podcast continues to provide support, of course- they’ve done special prizes in the past, and underwrite the technical costs of ListJuggler, upon which we increasingly depend. They wouldn’t, however, be able to cover the costs of prizes at our current level.
    Our costs for the last few seasons, assuming that we’d now be paying for the TC templates, work out to somewhere in the neighborhood of $230.00 per season. (Previously, our biggest cost was postage for prizes (Earthworm), which ran about $30.00/season along with ListJuggler’s hosting fees (Sozin) and Premier Challonge account/API access (Sozin last year, Earthworm this year). Challonge may possibly go away in the future, and LJ will also continue to be supported by Scum and Villainy, but the cost of prizes will swamp any of that.
    One solution is to look for additional sponsors. I’m not particularly connected outside the Seattle x-wing community, so unless you want nothing but Evergreen Squadron Radio stickers as prizes, we’ll have to look further afield. We’re open to your ideas or acquaintances for prize support or other forms of sponsorship.
    The other solution is to collect a small fee from each player. This season saw 286 players registered and placed in divisions- 130 new players, and 156 returning players. A fee might have a chilling effect on new signups, but collecting $1.50 from all returning players would pretty much cover our costs. What are your thoughts on this? Would you prefer to continue as a free league, but without prizes, or pony up a little for some goodies every now and then? Alternatively, we could operate by suggested donation, with prizes available only to paying players, though this would probably also result in fewer prizes.
    Slack Messages

    We’re on a free Slack account. I talked them into relaxing our signup limit, which has been useful, but we now contend with the 10,000 message limit imposed on free teams. With 351 total and 224 active members, we run into that pretty quickly, and messages more than about two weeks old (including pinned messages) are no longer available. Upgrading to a paid team with our membership size would apparently cost $17,000 per year, which would sort of wipe out your $1.50 entry fee….
    There’s not really anything that we can do about this, so please remember that stuff will disappear, and posting your availability last month won’t mean that people can see it this month.
    We’re looking at posting official announcements and such back on the Reddit page for the time being.
